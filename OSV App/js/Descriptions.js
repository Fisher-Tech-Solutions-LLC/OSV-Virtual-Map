By 1800, the majority of towns were divided into districts with neighborhood schools. Schools were in session between December and March, when older children did not need to work on the farm. Younger children, too small to help with chores and likely to be underfoot, also attended school between May and August. With up to 50 students of all ages, discipline was often hard to maintain, and punishments were sometimes severe. Teachers, or “school-keepers,” were usually between 17 and 25 years old and had only a district school education themselves.' +

Many 19th-century New England towns had several different meetinghouses, reflecting the region’s increase in religious diversity after the Revolutionary War. The two largest denominations in most rural towns were Congregationalists and Baptists, both descended from the Puritan Church of the first English settlers. In many rural towns, Methodists, Universalists, Episcopalians, and Friends also had their own houses of worship.' + '<br>' +

Newspapers were seldom profitable in small towns, but many rural printers tried to make money from them. In order to have a variety of titles for their customers, rural printers exchanged large quantities of books with printers throughout New England. Then they sold the books to country merchants, often taking store goods in exchange. By 1820, many were printing books for publishers in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. </p>' +
